    		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>In our project we will implement an non-photorealistic algorithm that allows artists to customize the look of a model by giving examples of how creases in the model should look. The algorithm then fills in the creases in the rendered model with strokes similar to the examples given. We will create a WebGL application that can load models and interactively let users customize their appearances.</p>

    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <ul>
        	<li>Non-Photorealistic Rendering is a class of problems in rendering in which the goal is to generate images that look more like art than real life. Much of NPR was inspired by how cold and bleak photorealistic images look: they lack character and are impersonal. NPR focuses on rendering scenes that give the artist freedom in the representation medium. Our project focuses on looking at creases in an image, and allowing the artist to easily prototype what they want creases to look like, instead of straight lines. This involves defining the stroke, finding creases in the model, and applying the stroke to each crease; in the case of multiple strokes for nonuniformity, this also involves intelligently assigning each crease to a stroke.</li>
        	<li>Rather than defining algorithms that emulate hand drawn styles, this project aims to create a flexible framework that can enable artists to easily define a style to render their meshes in, by directly drawing in some example strokes. It can be a valuable tool for them!</li>
        	<li>Mainly: a stroke-based rendering algorithm</li>
        	<li>The challenging part of this project that there can be many creases in an image but we want to enable an artist to only define a few example strokes. Using these strokes, we want to be able to generate more strokes that are just like it to fill out the rest of the mesh with. Preserving temporal locality based on the strokes will also need to be addressed, in order to allow for rotating the mesh in the viewport.</li>
    	</ul>


    <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <ul>
        	<li>We will develop a WebGL application that one can run in the browser, that shows a 3D model, and provides the user with a mouse interface to define strokes onto the model; these strokes are applied to the creases in the model in real time to provide feedback. </li>
        	<li>Since NPR is focused on creating artistic renders, it can be difficult to judge the performance of it. However, there are certain criteria that our system should satisfy: it should work in real time, and it must be aesthetically pleasing.</li>
        	<li>For measurements of accuracy, we will analyze how well it synthesizes/utilizes the input strokes; predictability vs consistency</li>
        	<li>We will also compare a hand-drawn sketch to the generated image; is it similar?</li>
        	<li>Deliverables</li>
		<ul>
			<li>We plan to deliver an interactive WebGL application that allows users to customize the creases in a model by defining how the creases should look. </li>
			<li>As a stretch goal, we hope to improve the algorithm to produce renders that are as close to its hand-drawn counterparts as possible. We can experiment with different methods to accomplish this: one idea is to procedurally generate similar strokes to the given examples to avoid repetitive assignments.</li>
		</ul>
    	</ul>

		<h2>Tasks & Subtasks</h2>
		<p>We will split our project into three primary tasks, with each teammate mainly responsible for one of these:</p>
